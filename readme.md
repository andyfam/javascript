# Random

In order to generate random number, we need to use Math.random() function which can generate number between 0 to 1.

# String

String object has some useful function to manipulate it. We can use slice() methond to get a substring.

# Strict Equality

Strict equality used to compare not only the value but also the data type of the variables.

`==` only compare the value, so number `1` equals to the string `'1'`
