# Random

In order to generate random number, we need to use Math.random() function which can generate number between 0 to 1.

# String

String object has some useful function to manipulate it. We can use slice() methond to get a substring.

# Strict Equality

Strict equality used to compare not only the value but also the data type of the variables.

`==` only compare the value, so number `1` equals to the string `'1'`

# Array

We use array to hold more than a value. 

# Some method used for Array
## Foreach

Foreach() method is used for iterate the elements in an array, and apply a function to each element.

## map

Map() methond is used for iterate the elements in an array, and apply a function to each element, then return an new array.

## filter

Filter() method fiter the elements in an array based on a function.

## reduce
reduce() method used to reduce an array to a single value

# Spread Operator

Spread operator `...` used to unpacking iterable element like array, string.

# Rest Parameter

Rest parameter `...` used to bundle multiple parameters into an array.

# Callback

Callback is use a function as a parameter for another function, which can operate asynchronous operation and make sure one function is executed after another.
